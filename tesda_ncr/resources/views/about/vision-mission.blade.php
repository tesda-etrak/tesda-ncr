                        technical education and skills development (TESD) in the Philippines. It was created by virtue of Republic Act 7796, otherwise known as the 
                        “Technical Education and Skills Development Act of 1994”. The said Act integrated the functions of the former National Manpower and Youth Council (NMYC), 
                        the Bureau of Technical-Vocational Education of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (BTVE-DECS) and the Office of Apprenticeship of the 
                        Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).
